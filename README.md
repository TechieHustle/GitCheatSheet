# GitCheatSheet
Contains Quick Reference for general Git tasks.

- `-u` or `--set-upstream`: `-u origin a_branch` or `--set-upstream origin a_branch` flags in any of the commands mean that we are setting the upstream reference branch for the current brach to `a_branch`.\\
  NOTE: `a_branch` branch can be a different name from the local branch name, but local will follow `a_branch` as the reference branch.
